# Zombies

A demo that shows how to send emergency notifications to a TV app.

### Install Node.js

Install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) runtime environment. Node.js is a tool that is used to run the Zombies server, which is implemented as a JavaScript script. 

### Change to Zombies directory

```all
cd ~/Downloads/zombies
```
Open a terminal and change to the Zombies API directory, wherever you have downloaded it.

### Install node modules

```all
npm install
```
Then use the node package manager to install the required packages and their dependencies. The npm tool will look in the package.json file to find out which packages need to be installed.

### Start the server

```all
node zombies.js
```
In a separate terminal window or tab, start the Zombies server. This will tell Node.js to run the zombies.js script and wait for incoming connections.

### Start page

You can open the start page by going to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser. Substitute the name of your computer to connect from other devices.
